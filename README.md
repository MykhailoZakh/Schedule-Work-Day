# Schedule-Work-Day
Modifying existing web app  Work Day Scheduler

## Description

I made web site with a game that have some questions about JavaScript. I wanted to make a game that starts from the button and then loop some questions. A timer should work during the game ,and if you choose some answer time is added or subtracted. After the game I want to add my initials to the form and save it with my score.
